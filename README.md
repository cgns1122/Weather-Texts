Weather-Texts
=============
The Weather Texts app sends the given phone number a text message every morning with the weather for that day,
including the temperature, the weather conditions, the chance of rain, and the humidity, as well as recommended
clothing suggestions, such as rainboots or light clothes.

To use WT, simply open the messaging.rb document and go into the text_chiara method.  Paste your or the
recipient's phone number into the "to" key.  Put in your own Twilio account details.  Lastly, go into Rakefile and app.rb and paste the weather.com link to your zip code or place of choice between the quotes within the parentheses.

Upload to Heroku and schedule to text you once a day.

Enjoy!
