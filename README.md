Weather-Texts
=============
The Weather Texts app sends the given phone number a text message every morning with the weather for that day,
including the temperature, the weather conditions, the chance of rain, and the humidity, as well as recommended
clothing suggestions, such as rainboots or light clothes.

To use WT, simply open the texting.rb document and go into the text_chiara method.  Paste your or the
recipient's phone number into the "to" key.  If you would like, replace the Twilio account details with your
own.  Lastly, go into the rakefile and paste the weather.com link to your area between quotes within the parentheses.

Enjoy!
